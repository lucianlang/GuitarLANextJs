# GuitarLA - Next.js

GuitarLA is an online guitar store built using React and Next.js. This project was developed as part of the course "Next.js and React - La Gu√≠a Completa" by Juan Pablo de la Torre Valdez on Udemy. It incorporates various features and concepts, including styled components, API integration with getStaticProps and getServerSideProps, dynamic routing with getStaticPaths and getStaticProps, and the usage of Strapi and Cloudinary to create the API. Additionally, some more features were included by myself like a custom cart pop-up feature that was implemented using the Toastify library.
